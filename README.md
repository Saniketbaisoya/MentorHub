- 1. Project Overview
- MentorHub is an online platform designed to connect mentors with mentees. The backend is built using Node.js, with Express as the web framework and MongoDB as the database. The backend manages functionalities such as authentication, booking of mentors, scheduling, and payments through Razorpay.
### The main components of the backend include:
- User authentication is done using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing.
- Booking Management for scheduling mentor sessions.
- Payment Integration using Razorpay.
- Mentor Availability Management for setting availability.
- API Validations using Joi for schema validation.
- Email notifications with Nodemailer for booking confirmations.

- Project Setup

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

### Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB (Make sure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible)
- Cloudinary (For image storage)
- Zoom API credentials (For online meetings)
- Razorpay (For payment processing)

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

- Clone the Repository
- git clone <your-repository-url>
- cd mentorhub-backend
### 2     Install Dependencies Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
- npm install
### This will install all the project dependencies and devDependencies listed in the package.json file:
- bcrypt, cloudinary, cookie-parser, cors, dotenv, ejs, express, joi, jsonwebtoken, moment, mongoose, multer, nodemailer, razorpay, etc.
- 3    Configure Environment Variables You need to create a .env file at the root of your project directory. Use the .env.example file as a reference.
- cp .env.example .env
### In the .env file, fill in the following details:
- PORT=<port number>
- DB_URL=<mongodb url>
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<cloudinary cloud name>
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<cloudinary api key>
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<cloudinary api secret>
- SMTP_PASSWORD=<smtp password>
- SMTP_USERNAME=<smtp username>
- EMAIL_FROM=<email from>
- SMTP_HOST=<smtp host>
- SMTP_PORT=<smtp port>
- RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<razorpay key id>
- RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<razorpay key secret>
- ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=<zoom account id>
- ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=<zoom client id>
- ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=<zoom client secret>
### 4      Run the Development Server To start the server in development mode, use:
- Npm run dev
- This command uses nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.
### 5     Running the Server in Production To start the server in production mode, use:
- npm start
- 6  Verify the Setup
- Use a tool like Postman or cURL to hit the API endpoints defined in the project.
- Check if the server is running without any errors, and verify connections to MongoDB, Cloudinary, and other external services.
- Open a browser and go to http://localhost:<PORT> to check if the server is running.
- Ensure MongoDB is connected and functional.
- Verify that third-party services like Cloudinary, SMTP, Zoom, and Razorpay are configured correctly.
